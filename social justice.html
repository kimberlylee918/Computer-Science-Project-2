	<p> Homelessness is a complex social problem and therefore one cannot attribute the root of the problem to just one issue. The causes for homelessness varies: </p>
	<ul> 
	<li> Lack of affordable housing (most common) </li>
	<li> Poverty </li>
	<li> Sudden sickness </li>
	<li> Family composition changes (divorce, sudden illness, death of one of the members) </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p> Despite the decrease on federal and state funding for organizations and shelters that are trying to improve the quality of life for people who are experiencing homelessness. Many cities have made it a crime to be a homeless person: they are ticketed or process for their need to sleep, eat and cover their basic needs. </p>
	<br>
	<p> Veterans often experience homelessness because of disabilities caused by their experience on the battlefield. Physical injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mental suffering are just a few of the wartime after effects that drive the population of homeless veterans. </p>
